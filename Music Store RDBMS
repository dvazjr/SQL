# This data is based on customer purchase information and music sales. Practicing all SQL methods learned thus far to include joins, logical operators, comparison operators, clauses, functions and calculations.

# These are questions I made up myself regarding the data in the various related tables in the database:



  # What were the 10 most popular artists among the customer purchases in order from most to least? Show the results, artist, and a column that states 'TRL's Most Wanted' as their status.

  INNER JOIN chinook.artists ON albums.ArtistId = artists.ArtistId
  INNER JOIN chinook.invoice_items ON tracks.TrackId = invoice_items.TrackId
  GROUP BY artists.ArtistId, artists.Name
  ORDER BY COUNT(invoice_items.TrackId)desc
